            "I have to be honest, when I am traveling, the last thing I really care about is how cute I look. I have a strict no make-up rule when traveling because my skin freaks out when I do. That being said, I no longer feel like I am the age where I can get away with wearing pajamas on the plane. I want to wear something that is comfortable for travel but can also transition out for a quick bite outside of the airport if need be. I have pretty much kept to the same uniform for the last couple years. My trusty bootcut gap jeans, pumas, slouchy tee, and jacket (in many cases lately, this oversized trench). The coat is perfect because it doubles as a blanket. We had a 12 hour layover in NYC and I was super grateful to have something this warm to wear when we ventured outside! more at http://lovelaughexplore.com/2016/04/05/travel-style-tel-aviv-via-jfk/\n",

Visually, they make your hips look wider and shorten your height - hence, the trickiness. If you are a petite lady with pear body type (like me!), you can get some extra height from platform sandals or high-waisted pants. I decided to style something fresh to inspire you. I'm wearing my new palazzo Tobi pants, along with open back top from Tobi. To keep my black and white theme, I wore my Asos striped blazer and cute mini bag.\n",

For date night a few week’s back I put on this ensemble which turn out really cute, subtle and sexy for dinner and some shisha. Khaki is a very chic colour to wear in the winter; it stands out without being too loud. I wore a mixture of khaki tones with black for a classic and simple mix but spiced it up with a leather jacket for an edgy appeal to finish it off. Its cool when you add some layering to your look, which basically changes it up! Check out all the links below to wear you can shop these exact items too!\n",

Bought really cheaply in Vero Moda outlet, it looks a bit like a blanket and it's just as warm. I kid you not!\n",

            "Forever 21 is one of my favorite stores since 2013! They always have crazy deals and super stylish clothes. Every month, I spend hours and hours to find something special and have never been disappointed. I remember returning two items that weren't perfect. Not so bad, right? I even buy clothes for my sister in Kazakhstan, because she loves this brand too. Sadly, they don't deliver to many countries still. I have been keeping my eye on these striped wide-leg pants since last month, and finally got them along with this printed tee and suede jacket. Thanks Forever 21 for featuring my selfie on their main Instagram page. It was exciting! Today, I wanted to show how you can style these items together in a way that you would never have thought. Wide-leg pants have been very trendy from previous years, and these line up nicely with my big love of striped clothes. Graphic tee are a must-have! As for the suede jacket, I love how soft is feels. I will try to style it with a mini skirt for you next time!\n",

            "I'll be honest, now that we have the kiddo in our lives, my weekend outfits can't require too much thought process or we'll never make it out the door. But I have to say, with the right staples, it is possible to throw something together in a matter of minutes and not look like a total hobo. This is one of my favorite combos of late - a plaid button-down, military jacket, leather leggings, and some comfortable flats. What's your go-to, no-thought-process-required look?\n",

Definitely one of those brands you go to for statement-but-not-too-over-the-top pieces. I think you all probably know how much I love western-inspired pieces and high-necked things so Ganni pretty much checks all of those boxes (these boots being my next most likely target).\n",

Sure, they can be toned down in a more subtle hue, but in a fiery shade of red, they just about scream \"not afraid to take fashion risks.\" I'd say that's partially true. While I do love to take risks occasionally with my outfits I also feel that the best outfits are balanced. Since I knew these boots were going to be sassy and sexy, I styled the top half of my outfit in a more toned down, preppy, girl-next-door sort of way. And this was the perfect color combination for the holiday season.\n",

When it comes to dressing up, I always like to focus on one thing that will make my outfit pop, sometimes it can be a pair of cute heels or a great blazer, and sometimes it can be a fabulous accessory. That's what I love about fashion, you don't always need your clothing to be the one that's making the statement. Accessories work great too! I planned my whole outfit around this pretty bow and I'm sure that I did because all day I just wanted to twirl in the sun.\n",

            "Confession: I’m a full-on adopter of the shower slides trend. Call it my ’90s upbringing, but when Adidas shower slides first started making a comeback, I was positively gleeful. So when Miu Miu took it to the next level and embellished them with pearls, well, you can kind of say it made my spring. I wasn’t quite ready to splurge on the real deal so imagine my delight when I found a similar pair on Zara for a steal. I wore this fancied-up pool outfit to the Westover Beer Garden (a family favorite) on a warm and sunny Sunday not too long ago. Here’s hoping we’ll get some of that beautiful weather back this weekend!\n",

            "Isn’t it nice to stumble across a piece that breathes new life into your work wardrobe? I feel like it’s always a challenge to find clothes that are fun and interesting, but still work-appropriate. Like most of the fashion world right now, I’m pretty obsessed with Monse and the whole “shirting” trend in general. So when this lookalike dress went on sale over Memorial Day weekend, I popped it right into my my shopping cart. Paired with two-tone, spectator-style mary janes and a patent tote, I think it makes a neat little play on menswear. How do you spice up your office wardrobe while still remaining appropriate? Office dress codes vary so wildly these days, I’m always curious what other people are able to get away with.\n",

            "Long, flowing healthy hair is one of those things that we all strive to have, but with dyes, frequent use of hot tools and products that totally dry out our hair (ahem, hairspray) it seems to be something that is so hard to come by. I wanted to find a product that would restore my strands and have them looking their absolute best this summer, so I decided to try Hair Food. Hair Food is inspired by super foods and their new Color Protect Collection doesn't contain any sulfates or parabens so I knew right away that it was for me. I've been using the conditioner weekly and I always leave it in my hair for a few hours while I work on the computer. This allows the conditioner to really penetrate my strands and gives me longer lasting softness, something that my hair is in desperate need of since we live in such a dry climate. Once I became hooked on the Shampoo & Conditioner I decided to give their dry shampoo a try - It smells delicious, blends into my hair quickly and gives my mane a little extra bounce when it's looking limp between washes.\n",

            "This dress is so old I had to go check who did it. I wasn’t sure if it’s Mango, Zara or Topshop. I remember buying it in Manila almost 15 years ago. I was right with my first guess. Mango. A lot of fabric but light and airy. Perfect for twirling. The flowers are pretty. If you are like me who love florals, like me, you’d know which floral is good. Because you have too many. Sexy back as well cuz it’s not for me unless it’s designed to show off my best 'accessory'- my spine tattoo. (Wink) I have committed the crime of altering master pieces that were not backless. You don't edit a Donna? But to update a Marilyn, you gotta have ink. I’d wear this one till it dies on me. \n",

            "Hello, guys! It might a bit late to share, but it's better later than never. This year, instead of celebrating Valentine's day, my BFF Elyse (blogger of Faith In Style) and I decided to take a trip to Salvation Mountain and shoot our outfits to celebrate Galentine's day there. We wore some wonderful outfits that were provided by Lulus, and were lucky that the beautiful Claire Arceri did our make-up. After getting ready, we climbed the mountain and Andrew (her husband) took action to shoot two lovely gals in matching outfits. Since I have no patience, I decided to edit the photos myself and share with my readers our final team work. Salvation Mountain is an art project that is located in the Colorado Desert. If you ever plan to visit southern California, you should definitely check it out. Also, you can donate paints to the organization so they can continue working on this spectacular project that was started by Leonardo Knight, who died in 2014. I definitely advise you to visit this unique place. It's worth driving there and seeing a sunset on the top of mountain.\n",

The days are filled with fashion, strolling the cobblestone streets of Paris and catching up with some of my favorite blogger girls. In order to get all over town (for work and play!) looking chic I rely on great accessories. For today's looks, I styled my floral Just Fab blazer and pink bag two different ways. For the first look, I wanted something casual and comfortable for touring around Montmartre after a busy day of shows, so I styled a pink suede dress with pink sneakers and a matching bag for a look that was monochromatic yet visually interesting. For my second look, I wanted to style my denim for a casual afternoon meeting, so I paired it with blue almond-toed pumps, a burnt orange blouse and simple gold accessories. Styling things multiple ways is the perfect way to save room and avoid overweigh baggage fees when traveling! Do you ever do this on trips?\n",

But blogging and creating takes a lot of time and energy, and requires finding inspiration. I would love to share with you a few tips for how can you set up an editorial photo shoot. Think of the concept. I always looked up what I wanted via Pinterest or Instagram. I'm not looking so much for bloggers' pictures, but more looking at what models/ photographers have done. Think of the location. Location is usually a really important aspect for your photoshoot. Of course, outdoors is always best not just for cool places, but also for the photography reasons if you don't have a photography skills (shooting in daylight and outside is easiest).Think of the outfit. The outfit can create not only a strong image but also tell the story of your concept.Hair/ Make Up Style. I barely think of these things because I'm bad at styling my hair and my face. But if you work with professionals, make sure to tell them what you are looking for.Editing Skills. Luckily, I know how to use certain programs for editing, but I keep learning from Youtube channels like Photoshop Tutorials, Lightroom Editing etc.\n",

            "Hello, guys! It might a bit late to share, but it's better later than never. This year, instead of celebrating Valentine's day, my BFF Elyse (blogger of Faith In Style) and I decided to take a trip to Salvation Mountain and shoot our outfits to celebrate Galentine's day there. We wore some wonderful outfits that were provided by Lulus, and were lucky that the beautiful Claire Arceri did our make-up. After getting ready, we climbed the mountain and Andrew (her husband) took action to shoot two lovely gals in matching outfits. Since I have no patience, I decided to edit the photos myself and share with my readers our final team work. Salvation Mountain is an art project that is located in the Colorado Desert. If you ever plan to visit southern California, you should definitely check it out. Also, you can donate paints to the organization so they can continue working on this spectacular project that was started by Leonardo Knight, who died in 2014. I definitely advise you to visit this unique place. It's worth driving there and seeing a sunset on the top of mountain.\n",

            "I told myself that I was going to hold off on making any new, big, purchases for a while since I'm trying to be an adult and save money and all that good (not so fun) stuff. But then one day while I was scrolling on ebay I spotted this gorgeous Dolce & Gabbana bag - brand new with tags! The bag was still on the D&G website at the time for over $2,500 but for something that is this trendy, I would never pay that. So when I saw it on ebay with the bid starting at $1,200 I thought, hmmm, interesting. I put it on my watch list to see what it would go for but when the bidding ended, and nobody had made an offer, I knew that it was my chance to make a move. I contacted the seller and offered her $800 plus shipping and she countered at $850! Insert happy dance here! While I know I was supposed to be saving (I'll start tomorrow, promise!) this was just wayyy too good of a deal to pass up. I took the bag to a re-sale shop to have it appraised and they certified that it is authentic. What a steal of a deal! I go totally weak in the knees for sparkles and this little box bag was just what I needed to make my heart incredibly happy. I paired it with a faux fur capelet and a little pink skirt for a look that was perfect for a breakfast date. This was my first handbag purchase on ebay but certainly won't be my last.\n",

I love how the floral pattern of the shawl ties in the mesh lace midriff of my Tobi lace skater dress! The bold fringe hanging from the shawl also adds to the bohemian look I wanted.\n",

Head turning outfits aren't the only thing that will make people stop and stare, your makeup is just as important! Especially when you're heading out to fabulous fêtes. I used Rimmel London's \"Get The Look\" app to get me party ready. A few days before the party, I uploaded inspirational makeup looks that I found in magazines and on the web and tried them on myself with ease! All I had to do was take a selfie. It was quick and easy to see which makeup trends were hot and which were not. As much as I love to play with new looks, maybe bright blue eyeshadow just isn't for me.\n",

Lulu's always has the perfect dresses for formal occasions. I loved styling this little white number. I kept things monochromatic by stickling with only white, gold and silver.\n",

For the occasion, I wanted to wear something a little bit whimsical, and it’s hard to take oneself too seriously while donning a ruby red, faux fur stole. It even matched the red carpet at the Kennedy Center – the veritable “cherry on top” on an epic evening!\n",

            "The start of fall means stocking up on all of your wardrobe must haves for the season. In my closet, that means boots and lots of 'em! Over the knee boots, chunky heeled boots, stiletto boots, colored boots, basic boots, leather boots, suede boots. You name it I want it. Why? Because boots can make or break any outfit and the right pair, can get you through fall and winter in style. For today's post, I'm partnering with Clarks & Zappos to share one of my new favorite pairs! I love this style because the cognac color is so versatile. You can pair them with black, brown and every color in between. I also love this style because the heel isn't sky high, so it makes them perfect for weekend strolling or even hours of holiday shopping. Zappos made finding these boots a breeze! Their shipping is insanely fast and they have a 365 day return policy. If that doesn't make you want to load up your (online) shopping cart I don't know what will! 'Tis the season! Well, almost.\n",

            "Sometimes we don't realize how much our surroundings influence us. We subconsciously make choices based on what we're exposed to and we develop our taste and personal style based on our environment. Living in Los Angeles has made me appreciate fashion that is colorful, ladylike and sophisticated. I love to juxtapose different styles to create an outfit that is visually interesting and unique. In today's look, I paired a snake print INC International Concepts trench with a burgundy tunic and a matching burgundy statement necklace. Comfortable dresses are always a go-to for me and styles with elegant details like buttons and lace are even more appealing. This look could easily be dressed down with tights and black booties, but I decided to keep things polished by adding sleek pointed toed pumps and a suede crossbody bag -- perfect for a day of meetings in Manhattan. Even when I travel, my LA style shines through. And, who says you can't bring a little bit of LA color to The big apple?\n",

            "Going out to your mailbox is often daunting because it means bills on top of bills on top of bills. But every once in a while, therein lies a glossy envelope and inside it, a greeting card that gives you the warm and fuzzies. It's often unexpected but the joy that you feel once you see the front of it is unparalleled. Sure it's easy to drop a nice note on someones Facebook wall, or even to send a tried and true e-card, but there's nothing like knowing that someone took the time to hand select a special card for you and then sealed the envelope, slapped a stamp on it and put it in the mail. Mailing a greeting card may seem old fashioned, but it's a great way to go the extra mile on a special occasion.\n",

My blogger friend, Elyse (check her blog Faith In Style), and I decided to take a trip to NYC.After a long flight and having a big dinner in one of newest restaurants in K town, we went straight to the Empire State Building. The next morning, we planned a photoshoot for IFBK Seoul. It was quite an adventure to get all the people in one location, but we finally did. We tried to stay as active as possible by running to fashion shows, meeting with bloggers and other cool people, shooting outfits, doing some sightseeing, and even finding time to snack or grab a coffee along the way. Here is a shoot of the outfit that I wore on the first night. I'm wearing a beautiful lace dress from Storets. The color green is going to be trendy this season. \n",

            "If you’ve been following my blog for a while now, you might have noticed I have an affinity for Joie. Their pieces have that wonderfully laid-back California vibe, while still being extremely versatile and well-made (as you can see, I’ve worn many of my Joie pieces for years and years). So I was delighted when I heard they were bringing a storefront to Tysons II and invited me to come check out the new digs. A nearby spot to pick up all of my much-loved basics – yes! I was stoked to see they carry shoes, too and already set my sights on these over-the-knee beauties for fall. I picked up this super soft and drapey LBD that I’ve been wearing constantly (I wore this outfit to meet up with friends at Radiator last Friday night). I love that it has that slip dress feel that’s so trendy right now without being too clingy and thin like lingerie. Joie delivers a perfect staple once again!\n",

I've never understood how people in my country can host guests every day! I would probably fail as a true Kazakh wife. Haha.Well, it is the last day of summer, and we are back to our normal schedule. By this I mean, parents are getting their kids ready for the school season, teachers are back at work, and of course, college students are heading back to campus. Last year, I wrote a post about what teachers should wear. This time, I decided to think about what one could wear if you have a job interview or even a college admissions interview. Of course, you want to wear something elegant, clean, and representable. You should check out this beautiful dress from Storets. I styled it with my classic kitten heels and a tote bag.\n",

            "\"Pull over! We have to shoot by those pink shutters!\" I exclaimed as we drove through the streets of Santa Barbara. People always ask, \"how do you find the locations that you shoot at?\" My response? You stumble upon them! You jump in your car wearing something that you want to shoot and as soon as you see a great location that matches it you pull over and hopefully find a (legal) place to park. What I don't recommend is seeing a spot and saying \"let's come back to it later\" because more often than not you either won't go back, or you won't be able to find it again. After all, you did stumble upon it. With that being said, these pink shutters absolutely stole my heart and served as the perfect backdrop for shooting this dainty white dress.\n",

Whether they are a part of an off the shoulder top, a breezy summer dress or a bold bodycon like this one, big sleeves are a trend that I am absolutely loving! I paired this little fuchsia number with floral pumps, a glamorous silver clutch and statement earrings for a look that would have been perfect for strolling in the streets of Miami.\n"
